#+title: Phase15 Test

 1. Recording Features

  Recording Visual Feedback

  - Start recording → pulsing red border appears around waveform
  - "RECORDING..." text displays in top-left with glow effect
  - Progress bar fills from left to right during 4-second recording
  - Red pulsing dot appears in top-right corner
  - Red "REC" playhead line moves across waveform during recording
  - All indicators disappear when recording stops

  Sample Cropping

  - Click "CROP MODE" button → yellow pulsing border appears
  - "CROP MODE - Select region to keep" text displays
  - Drag to select region → yellow highlight appears on selection
  - "✂ APPLY CROP" button appears when crop mode active
  - Click apply crop → buffer crops to selected region only
  - Waveform updates to show cropped sample
  - Loop bounds reset to 0-1 (full new buffer)
  - Crop mode exits automatically after applying

  2. Concurrent Engine Mode

  Engine Controls

  - Both engines start OFF (gray buttons)
  - Click "GRAIN: OFF" → turns ON (green), grain engine plays
  - Click "SPECTRAL: OFF" → turns ON (yellow), spectral engine plays
  - Both engines can run simultaneously
  - Each engine can be toggled independently

  Visual Status Indicators

  - Grain engine ON → green pulsing dot + "GRAIN" label appears (top-left)
  - Spectral engine ON → yellow pulsing dot + "SPECTRAL" label appears
  - Both engines ON → cyan "CONCURRENT MODE" badge appears (top-right)
  - Status indicators disappear when engines turn OFF

  3. Playhead Tracking (CRITICAL BUG FIX)

  Separate Playhead Lines

  - Grain engine ON → green playhead line labeled "Grain" appears
  - Spectral engine ON → yellow playhead line labeled "Spectral" appears
  - Both engines ON → both playheads visible simultaneously
  - Playheads move independently at different speeds/positions
  - Recording → red playhead line labeled "REC" appears
  - All three playheads can be visible at same time (grain + spectral + recording)

  Grain Pulse Animation

  - Grain engine ON → green expanding pulse rings appear at playhead
  - Spectral engine only → NO pulse rings (bug fix verification)
  - Pulse frequency increases with higher overlap values

  ---
  4. Audio Verification

  Concurrent Mode Audio

  - Grain only → hear granular texture
  - Spectral only → hear spectral time-stretch/freeze
  - Both engines ON → hear summed output (layered sound)
  - Turning engines ON/OFF works without clicks/pops
  - No phase cancellation or audio artifacts in concurrent mode

  ---
  5. Known Issues to Watch For

  - Recording playhead actually moves (user reported it wasn't moving before)
  - ScanSpeed parameter affects grain playhead correctly (cyan line issue mentioned)
  - No playhead conflicts when both engines run (the bug we just fixed)
  - Crop function doesn't crash with edge cases (very small selections, etc.)

  ---
  Priority Tests:
  1. Concurrent playheads (green + yellow lines visible together)
  2. Recording playhead movement (red line actually advances)
  3. Crop functionality (select, apply, verify new buffer)
  4. Concurrent audio summing (both engines audible together)
